## 🔍 Featured Projects  
- **[Wine Quality Prediction Using ANN & MLflow](https://github.com/MeetSolanki100/wine-quality-prediction-using-ANN-mlflow)** 🍷  
   Making sense of wine with ANN models and tracking experiments with MLflow. Because who doesn’t want to predict a good wine rating?

- **[mlflow-start](https://github.com/MeetSolanki100/mlflow-start)** 📈  
   My dive into MLOps starts here! Experiment tracking, model management, and everything in between.

- **[flask](https://github.com/MeetSolanki100/flask)** 🔥  
   Testing the waters with Flask basics and building foundations for future AI-powered web apps.

- **[selenium-practice](https://github.com/MeetSolanki100/selenium-practice)** 🕸️  
   Automating the web with Selenium, because life’s too short to scrape data manually!

- **[gen-ai](https://github.com/MeetSolanki100/gen-ai)** 🤖  
   Exploring the future with generative AI. From language to image generation, this is where things get creative.
